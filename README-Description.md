# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

For this challenge I was tasked with refactoring the code for the Horiseon webpage. My goal for this refactor was to optimize the webpage in regards to accessibility standards.

# Changes:

```
I made the html cleaner by introducing more semantic elements and getting rid of a few divs. I also broke up the code by sections to make finding elements easier.

I reorganized the code to follow a more logical structure.

I included alt attributes in order to boost accessibility for people with screenreaders.

I changed the title of the webpage "Horiseon".

I editted the style.css file and consolidated many of the class descriptions from the HTML into a single group for mass changes.

I added comments in the style.css file to organize the elements according to the HTML file layout.

```
